# translationglossary
to help interpreters and translators worldwide to search and find the term at 95% after they input their field
write me a web app in javascript. The web app has a login page to provide an e-mail address and phone number, then send a security code to the user so the e-mail adress or phone number can be verified. after verification, the user is ready to go. The web app is mainly a glossary. the main function is to have the user input a term in his native language, then look into the glossary_database_second_language and find a term that is 95% accurate. The user has a "switch language button" that allows him to input a word or sentence in the second language, then have the results in his native language. Any verified user is allowed to input a new match if the glossary did not yield a result at 95% accuracy. All the new inputs are submitted to the team to be reviewed then approved. unapproved results should be flagged with "unaproved match" flag and "most popular unaproved match" depending on how many people rated it to be accurate.

Here's a basic outline of how you could structure your web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

HTML Structure:
index.html: This will contain the structure of your web app, including the login page and the main glossary interface.
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Glossary Web App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="login-page">
        <h2>Login</h2>
        <input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Email">
        <input type="tel" id="phone" placeholder="Phone">
        <button onclick="sendSecurityCode()">Send Code</button>
    </div>

    <div id="glossary-page" style="display:none;">
        <!-- Glossary Interface -->
    </div>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
CSS Styling:
styles.css: Define styles for your web app.
css
Copy code
/* Add your CSS styles here */
JavaScript Functionality:
script.js: Implement the functionality of your web app.
javascript
Copy code
// Function to send security code
function sendSecurityCode() {
    // Validate email and phone inputs
    var email = document.getElementById('email').value;
    var phone = document.getElementById('phone').value;

    // Implement logic to send security code
    // This could involve sending a code to the provided email or phone number
}

// Function to switch language
function switchLanguage() {
    // Implement logic to switch between native and second language
}

// Function to search glossary
function searchGlossary(term) {
    // Implement logic to search the glossary database
    // and return results with 95% accuracy
}

// Function to submit new match
function submitNewMatch() {
    // Implement logic to submit a new match to the team for review
    // This could involve sending the new match data to a server endpoint
}

// Function to handle login and display glossary interface
function handleLogin() {
    // Implement logic to verify user's credentials (email/phone verification)
    // If verified, display the glossary interface
    document.getElementById('login-page').style.display = 'none';
    document.getElementById('glossary-page').style.display = 'block';
}

// Call handleLogin() when the page loads (for testing purposes)
window.onload = handleLogin;
This is just a basic setup to get you started. You'll need to implement the actual functionality for sending security codes, verifying users, searching the glossary, switching languages, and submitting new matches. Additionally, you'll need to handle user authentication, database interactions, and server-side processing for reviewing and approving new matches. You can use frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js to build a more structured and scalable application.
